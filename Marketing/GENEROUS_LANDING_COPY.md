## What is Generous?

Generous is a streaming generative UI platform that transforms AI output into living, interactive interfaces.

Most AI tools generate code you copy and paste. Generous generates and renders components in real-time — streaming them progressively as the AI thinks.

Describe a sales dashboard. Get a live dashboard with working charts and filters.
Ask for a 3D molecular viewer. Get an interactive Three.js scene.
Request a kanban board. Get a drag-and-drop workflow interface.

**114+ composable components.** Data visualization. 3D graphics. Maps. Code editors. Games. Social feeds. Workflow tools. From simple buttons to complex analytical dashboards, all rendered on demand.

This is what happens when you give AI a real canvas instead of a text box.

## Why Generous is Different

### Streaming Generative UI
Components don't wait for the AI to finish. They stream in progressively, rendering updates in real-time as tokens arrive. Watch your interface build itself.

### 114+ Components Across 8 Categories
- **Data Visualization:** Charts, graphs, metrics, heatmaps, sparklines
- **3D Graphics:** Scenes, models, particle systems, spatial visualizations
- **Maps:** Geographic data, layers, markers, routing, spatial analysis
- **Editors:** Code, markdown, rich text, collaborative editing
- **Games:** Interactive experiences, simulations, game mechanics
- **Social:** Feeds, profiles, cards, engagement interfaces
- **Workflow:** Kanban boards, forms, tables, task managers
- **AI Elements:** Chat, completions, structured outputs, agent interfaces

### Dual Rendering Architecture
**JSX** for simple, fast UI components.
**A2UI JSON** for complex, data-driven components that need deep interactivity.

The AI decides which to use based on what you ask for. You get the right tool for the job, automatically.

### Multi-Provider AI Support
Bring your own model. OpenAI. Anthropic. Google. Zhipu. Generous works with your preferred AI provider, giving you flexibility and avoiding lock-in.

## How It Works

**1. You ask**
"Show me monthly revenue as a line chart with quarterly comparisons."

**2. AI generates**
The model determines the right component, structure, and data bindings.

**3. Generous streams**
Components render progressively as the AI output arrives — no waiting for completion.

**4. You interact**
Live, working interface. Click, drag, filter, explore. Modify with follow-up prompts.

It's not code generation. It's interface generation.

## From Simple to Complex

### Simple Requests
"Create a pricing table with three tiers."
"Show a loading spinner with custom text."
"Make a hero section with centered content."

### Complex Requests
"Build a 3D solar system with orbital mechanics and planet info cards."
"Create an analytics dashboard with revenue trends, user cohorts, and geographic distribution."
"Design a code editor with syntax highlighting and live preview for React components."

Generous scales from the trivial to the sophisticated. One interface, infinite possibilities.

---

## What's in the Name?

**Generous** shares its linguistic DNA with **generate**, **genius**, **genie**, and **genuine** — all descended from the Latin *genus*, meaning origin or creation.

A generous interface is literally a generative one. An interface that creates. That gives freely. That responds abundantly to what you need.

We chose the name at a hackathon and never looked back. It turned out to be exactly right.

## Built in the Open

Generous is fully open source, part of the **Logos Liber** ecosystem — a constellation of tools for knowledge, intelligence, and creation.

### The Ecosystem

**Logos Liber** (logosliber.org)
The open-source ecosystem. Tools for thought, creation, and intelligence, freely available.

**Galaxy Brain** (galaxybrain.info)
The universal knowledge layer. Structured information that AI can actually use.

**Decentralized Intelligence Agency**
The 501(c)(3) nonprofit building infrastructure for collective intelligence. Mission-driven, not profit-driven.

**Monumental Systems**
The technical foundation. Built on Orleans actor framework for distributed, resilient systems.

We're not just building a product. We're building public infrastructure for the age of AI.

## Open Source, Open Architecture

Generous is MIT licensed and available on GitHub. Use it, fork it, contribute to it, build on it.

The platform is built with:
- **Next.js 16** and **React 19** for modern web architecture
- **Vercel AI SDK 6** for streaming AI interactions
- **TypeScript** for type safety and developer experience
- **Three.js** for 3D graphics
- **deck.gl** for advanced mapping
- **amCharts** and **Recharts** for data visualization
- **Phaser** for game development
- **30+ specialized libraries** for every use case

All integrated into one coherent, composable system.
