# Decentralized Intelligence Agency

## Intelligence, Liberated

The Decentralized Intelligence Agency is a 501(c)(3) scientific nonprofit dedicated to increasing collective intelligence through open-source research, development, and education.

We believe intelligence should be distributed, not concentrated. Knowledge should be free, not gated. Systems should empower individuals, not extract from them.

## What is the DIA?

The Decentralized Intelligence Agency inverts the traditional model of an intelligence agency. Where conventional intelligence organizations centralize knowledge, classify information, and concentrate power, the DIA decentralizes intelligence, liberates knowledge, and distributes capability.

We are a scientific nonprofit that funds research and development in collective intelligence, open-source AI systems, and decentralized knowledge infrastructure. Our work spans theoretical research, practical software development, and educational initiatives — all committed to increasing humanity's collective capacity to understand, create, and solve problems together.

Founded by the creator of the Logos Liber open-source ecosystem, the DIA serves as the philosophical and organizational foundation that guides a network of interconnected projects working toward a more intelligent, more free future.

## Our Mission

We increase collective intelligence by:

**Building open infrastructure for thought**
Creating tools and systems that amplify human intelligence without gatekeeping, surveillance, or extraction. Every system we build or fund is open source, designed to be owned and operated by anyone.

**Advancing research in distributed intelligence**
Supporting scientific research into how knowledge is created, shared, and synthesized across individuals and communities. We study collective intelligence not as metaphor, but as measurable phenomenon.

**Demonstrating alternatives to centralized AI**
Developing proof-of-concept systems that show decentralized, user-controlled AI is not just possible but superior for human flourishing. We build the future we want to inhabit.

**Educating and advocating**
Publishing research, teaching principles, and advocating for policy that protects open-source development, free expression, and decentralized systems.

## What We Build and Fund

The DIA supports an ecosystem of projects working toward collective intelligence:

### Logos Liber
The foundational open-source ecosystem for decentralized knowledge and AI systems. A comprehensive framework for building generous, user-controlled interfaces.
[logosliber.org](https://logosliber.org)

### Generous
A universal canvas for AI interaction featuring streaming generative UI. Generous demonstrates how AI interfaces can be expansive and user-empowering rather than constraining and extractive.

### Galaxy Brain
Universal knowledge management infrastructure designed for human thought, not corporate data models. Capture, connect, and synthesize knowledge across any context.

### Agents of Empire
Comprehensive AI agent management and orchestration. Built on the principle that users should control their agents, not rent them from platforms.

### Monumental Systems
Production-grade Orleans actor framework development. Co-founded with our technical leadership, Monumental Systems advances distributed systems architecture for real-world applications.

All DIA-funded projects are released as open source. We do not build proprietary systems. We do not gate knowledge behind paywalls. We do not extract value from users.

## Our Principles

### Decentralization Over Consolidation
Power concentrated is power abused. We build systems that distribute capability, resist monopoly, and enable individual sovereignty.

### Open Source Everything
Knowledge hidden is knowledge lost. Every line of code, every research finding, every design decision we make is published openly for anyone to use, study, modify, and share.

### Free Speech Maximalism
The right to speak, publish, and build without permission is foundational to human flourishing. We defend open platforms and resist censorship in all forms.

### Generous Interfaces
Software should be generous — giving users more power, more understanding, more capability. We reject dark patterns, engagement manipulation, and extractive design.

### Collective Intelligence
Individual intelligence is limited. Collective intelligence is unbounded. We build systems that help humans think together, learn together, and create together.

## Research Areas

Our research and development focuses on:

**Collective Intelligence Systems**
How do groups of humans create knowledge that exceeds individual capacity? How can we measure, model, and amplify collective intelligence? We study coordination mechanisms, knowledge synthesis, and collaborative reasoning.

**Open-Source AI Infrastructure**
What architectures enable user-controlled AI rather than platform-mediated AI? We research and build decentralized training, inference, and orchestration systems that resist centralized control.

**Decentralized Knowledge Architecture**
How should knowledge be structured, stored, and shared in systems designed for human agency rather than corporate extraction? We develop schemas, protocols, and interfaces for user-sovereign knowledge management.

**Generous Interface Design**
What makes an interface generous versus extractive? We conduct applied research in interface design that empowers rather than manipulates, educates rather than addicts.

**Distributed Systems for Intelligence**
How can actor models, CRDTs, and distributed computing paradigms support collective intelligence applications? We advance the state of distributed systems engineering for knowledge work.
